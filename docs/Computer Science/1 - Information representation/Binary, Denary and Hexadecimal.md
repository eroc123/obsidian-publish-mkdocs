## Denary

Denary uses base 10 and is the common number system we use in everyday life.

|$10^4$|$10^3$|$10^2$|$10^1$|$10^0$|
|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
|9|3|4|5|1| 

The above example shows the number 93,451 split into ones, tens, hundreds, thousands and ten thousands. Each digit (0,9) is placed into a "places" value, each with an increasing power of 10 (1, 10, 100, 1000). The same concept can be extended to binary and hexadecimal, except the place values use base 2 and base 16 respectively, with each column having an increasing power of the respective base.

## Binary

|$2^4$|$2^3$|$2^2$|$2^1$|$2^0$|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|1|0|1|0|0|

This shows the binary number 10100 split into place value columns, similar to the denary number. Binary numbers are represented with only states per digit, one or zero. The use of 1's and 0's represents the states of "on" or "off" respectively and is used by computers. Each place value has a base of 2, and each column is an increasing power of 2. 

## Hexadecimal

|$16^4$|$16^3$|$16^2$|$16^1$|$16^0$|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|5|E|6|2|F|

This shows the hex number 5E23F split into place value columns, similar to the denary number. Hex numbers have 16 states per digit, ranging from (0 to F). The values are represented by the numbers 0-9 and then A-F for 10 to 15 respectively. Hexadecimal has a base of 16.
