### Each [[Usage of number systems|character]] is represented by [[Binary, Denary and Hexadecimal|binary]] codes.

| ASCII                                                                         | Unicode                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Use 7 bits to represent each character/8 bits for extended ASCII              | Use up to for 4 bytes (32 bits) to represent each character                            |
| Contains less characters                                                      | Contains more characters                                                               |
| Only contain English language and contains some symbols                       | Can represent vast majority of scripts in the world                                    |
| Not standardized (Same code can mean different character in different system) | Standardized (a specific string of binary means the same character across all systems) |                                                                              |
