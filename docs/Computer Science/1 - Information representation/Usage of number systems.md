### [[Binary-coded Decimal (BCD)]]:  
##### Binary-coded Decimal have the advantage of providing easy conversion between denary (base 10) and binary (base 2).

- Digital clock and calculator display (easy for computer to output denary display)
- Storage of accounting information consisting of exact numerical values (almost impossible for computer to store denary decimal in binary exactly, therefore use BCD)

### [[Binary, Denary and Hexadecimal|Hexadecimal]]: 

##### Hexadecimal have the biggest advantage of being a much more compact representation of binary. They can also use less digits to store more information, e.g. denary can only store up to 100 values in 2 digits whilst hexadecimal can store 256. 

- Memory dumps (Memory contents are displayed for developing software or trace bugs, hexadecimal is more manageable then binary as it is much shorter)
- To define colours (e.g. # FFFFFF which means white, first two characters define red value, the next two define green value and the last two characters define the blue value - rgb) 
- Used to represent MAC addresses
