- Information is sent across the internet as [[Binary, Denary and Hexadecimal|bits]]
- Information sent across the internet has three main mediums:
	- Electricity
	- Light
	- Radio waves
- **Bandwidth:**
	- Maximum transmission capacity of a device - how much information can be sent by a device in a given period of time - rate of data transfer
- **Bit rate:**
	- Number of bits that can be sent over a given period of time.
		- A way to think of it is if you are sending information via a light bulb, where on is 1 and off is 0
		- When you send the information, you have a set bit rate, for example, 1 bit per second. 
		- This means that each second, you record whether the light bulb is on or off. This allows you to know how many 0's or how many 1's in a row you are recording.
		- For example, at 1 bit per second, if the light bulb remains off (0) for 5 seconds, then the string would be 00000.
			- five 0's as the state of the light bulb is recorded once per second for 5 seconds.
-   **Latency**: 
	- Time taken for a bit to travel from one place to another
