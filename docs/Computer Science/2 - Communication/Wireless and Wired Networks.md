- Different types of mediums for sending information and their uses

| ** Medium**        | Radio                                                                                                                                    | Light                                                              | Electricity                                      | Microwave                                                                           | 
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | 
| **Infrastructure** | None other than antenna, radio dishes, transmitters, possibly satellites                                                                                   | [[Fibre-Optic Cables]]                                             | [[Twisted pair cables]], [[Coaxial Cables]]      | Similar to radio waves                                                              |     
| **Pros**           | Completely mobile (no physical connection like wires needed), Does not require wires to be installed in buildings where it may be costly | Very fast. no signal loss                                          | Cheap                                            | Completely mobile, less attenuation (signal loss) compared to cables                |     
| **Cons**           | Short range, cannot transmit as much data                                                                                                | Expensive, hard to work with                                       | Signal loss over short to medium distances       | Short range, can be blocked by hills, mountains, rainfall due to shorter wavelength |     
| **Use**            | Radio stations, TV, [[Satellite communication]], Wifi networks,                                                                              | Connect continents and link the world together via undersea cables | Homes, offices, generally small geographic areas | Generally for point-to-point data transmission, [[Satellite communication]]             |
