**Hydraulic action** - Occurs when air gets trapped within a crack in a cliff. When a wave hits, the air gets compressed to high pressure. When the wave subsequently retreats, the air expands again. This can weaken rock faces and cause rocks to break off.

**Corrosion** - When weak acids in seawater dissolve alkaline rocks such as chalk or limestone

**Abrasion** - When small sediment such as pebbles within sea water are hurtled into a rock face when a wave hits, they can chip and scrape away at the rock face.

**Attrition** - When rocks, boulders, sand and pebbles collide and slowly wear each other down, especially angular corners.
