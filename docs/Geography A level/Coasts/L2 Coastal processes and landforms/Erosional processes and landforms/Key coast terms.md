###### **Emergent coast** **- coasts that have been exposed by the sea from a relative drop in sea levels of the area or when the land rises (uplift)**

###### **Isostatic change - a local rise or fall in land levels**

###### **Weathering - the breakdown of rock in situ.

###### **Erosion - the breakdown and transportation of rock**

###### **Deposition - the process by which sediment is released from flowing water when it loses energy** 
###### **Sub aerial processes - land-based processes that occur above the water line**
- e.g. sub-aerial weathering occurs above the water on cliff faces.
###### **Mass Movement - the downhill movement of sediment due to gravity**
