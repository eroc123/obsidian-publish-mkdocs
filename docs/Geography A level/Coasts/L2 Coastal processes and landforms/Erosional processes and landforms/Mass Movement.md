### Factors that affect [[Key coast terms#**Mass Movement - the downhill movement of sediment due to gravity**|Mass movement]] 
- Angle of slope or cliff
- Rock type and structure
- How wet the ground is
- Vegetation cover

| Flow  | Rate of movement | Type of mass movement    |
| ----- | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| Flow  | Imperceptible    | Soil creep, Solifluction |
| Flow  | Slow to rapid    | Earthflow/mudflow        |
| Slide | Slow to rapid    | Rock/debris slide, Slump                         |
