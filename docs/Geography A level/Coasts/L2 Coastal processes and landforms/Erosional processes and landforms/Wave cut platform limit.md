- Growth of a wave cut platform is limited to approximately 0.5 km
- This is because as a platform grows larger, waves have to travel further to reach the foot of the cliff to erode it.
	- This causes the wave to dissipate energy over the shallow platform, weakening its erosive power.
	- Eventually the wave cut platform becomes large enough to absorb the waves energy, thus negating its [[Erosion|erosive power]].
