| Displacement of soilds via wind, water or ice                                    | Decomposition of rocks via direct atmospheric contact                    |
| Eroded materials get displaced (break down and transport)                        | Weathered materials do not get displaced (break down on the spot)        |                     
| Different types of erosion include wind, water, ice, thermal and gravity erosion | Different types of weathering include: biological, chemical and physical |   
### Weathering 

##### Chemical weathering
- Breakdown of rocks via changing the chemical composition and structure
##### Mechanical 
- Breakdown of rocks via physical contact with the atmosphere via heat, water, ice, air, pressure and wind.
##### Biological weathering 
- Breakdown of rocks via living things, such as growing tree roots and animals.
