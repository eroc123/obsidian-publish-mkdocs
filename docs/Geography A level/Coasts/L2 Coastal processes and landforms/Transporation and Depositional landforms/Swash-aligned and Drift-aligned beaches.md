- Swash-aligned beaches have wave fronts which are perpendicular to the beach (waves going directly towards beach)
	- There is movement up and down the beach but not a lot of lateral movement (sediment transported along the beach)
- Drift-aligned becahes have wave fronts at an oblique angle (waves at an angle)
	- There is lateral movement of sediment via longshore drift and this allows sediment to be carried along the beach
