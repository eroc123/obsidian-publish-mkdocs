###### **Traction - Large particles like boulders are pushed along the sea bed by water** 
###### **Saltation - Pebble like particles are bounced along the sea bed by water** 

###### **Suspension - Small particles like silt or clay "float" in the water** 

###### **Solution - Soluble particles dissolve in the water and get carried along**
