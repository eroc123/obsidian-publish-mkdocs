- **Water in waves move in circular motion while its travelling through open ocean**

- **Friction** slows the waves down as they hit shallower water.
- This creates **elliptical motion** of the water in the waves, where the top moves faster than the bottom.
- Eventually, the top of the wave breaks over and crashes.
