- Have a strong swash - which is the water that rushes up the beach when a wave breaks
	- This leads to a large amount of material deposition, combined with the wave's low energy.
- Long wavelength  (up to 100m)
- Low frequency (less than 10 per minute)
- Low energy waves 
- Occur in areas where the beach gradient is flat
- Can form landforms such as spits, bars and tombolos
