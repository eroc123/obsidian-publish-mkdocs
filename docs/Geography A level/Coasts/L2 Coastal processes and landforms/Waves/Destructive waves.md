- Have a strong backwash- which is the water that flows back to the sea
	- This leads to a large amount of erosion, combined with the destructive wave's high energy.
- Short wavelength
- High frequency (above 10 per minute)
- High energy waves
- When breaking, these waves plunge down
- Can be created in storm conditions
- Occur in areas where the beach gradient is steep
- Erode coastlines and form features such as:
	- wave cut platforms
	- arches
	- stacks
	- stumps
	- caves
