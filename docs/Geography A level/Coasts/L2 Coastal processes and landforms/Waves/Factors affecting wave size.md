- Wind speed/strength, the higher the speed or strength, the stronger the wave
- Wind duration/time, the longer wind has blown, the stronger the wave
- Fetch, the distance which wind can travel unobstructed over open water
	- e.g. the southwest coast of the UK has very strong waves, due to the long fetch stretching over the Atlantic (3000 miles) combined with the prevailing wind direction blowing towards the UK.

**This is why locations facing open ocean often have stronger waves (due to longer fetch)**
