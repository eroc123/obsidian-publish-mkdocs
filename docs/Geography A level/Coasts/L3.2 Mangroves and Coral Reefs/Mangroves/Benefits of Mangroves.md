1. Provides a habitat for many species
	- Migratory birds stop in mangrove forests for food and rest such as birds which migrate from the Arctic to the Antarctic
	- Some birds nest in mangrove forests such as Pelicans and Spoonbills
	- Some species live in mud such as crabs and mudskippers
	- Many juvenile coral fish take shelter in mangrove forests from predators and get food from here
2. Coastal protection from storms and erosion
	- [[Mangrove's, Distribution and Characeristics|Tangled root systems]] above ground absorb up to 75% of wave energy, protecting the coastline from erosion and human settlements from large storms
	- ![[mangrove roots.png]]
		- For example, in Sri Lanka during the Indian Ocean tsunami, settlements that were protected by dense mangrove forests suffered much less damage compared to those that weren't (2 deaths in a village protected by mangrove compared to 6000 deaths in a village not protected by mangrove)
	- Thick root system also holds soil together
	- Can protect against storms such as hurricanes which are common in the tropical latitudes
3.  Marine fishery nursery
	- Many commercial fish nurse in mangrove forests and contribute to sustaining the local abundance of fish in the region.
	- E.g. 75% of commercially caught fish and prawns in Queensland, Australia depend on mangroves for part of their life cycle
4. Carbon sink
	- Mangrove trees can absorb carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere
	- Dead leaves, branches and roots from mangrove, which store carbon, can get buried into the muddy soil. Due to the oxygen-poor environment, they decompose very slowly, thus locking the carbon into the soil.

5. Source of resources for local communities
	- Mangroves provide food, medicine, fuel wood and construction materials for local communities
	- e.g. cutting wood to make charcoal, honey from flowers, dyes from bark
6. Improves coastal water quality 
	- Tangled root systems slow water and cause deposition of sediment. This sediment deposition can lock pollutants into the soil, thus filtering the water.
