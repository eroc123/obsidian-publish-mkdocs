- Mangrove's are a pioneer species which spread to new places via **seed dispersion**. Their seeds 
- Mangrove seeds can float and survive up to a year on the open ocean, which allow them to float to new areas and colonize them
- Their roots trap more sediment as they grow, which raises the height of the ground.
- They usually form within intertidal zones, where high-tides bring in new sediment.

### Ingredients for their formation

- High level of rainfall (1500mm-3000mm). 
- High temperature of 27 degrees
- Shallow water between 0.5-2.5 meters depth, but can survive slightly beyond this range too
- High humidity (75%-80%)
