**How it works:**
- Sand is added to the beach in order to make it wider
- Main idea is to increase distance a wave has to travel to reach cliffs, which allows its wave energy to dissipate
**Pros:**
- Beaches are a natural defense against erosion
- Promote tourism
	- Provides a natural environment for beachgoers and swimmers
- Cheap
**Cons:**
- Material required to expand the beach needs to be dredged
- Constant maintenance required
	- Storms can especially damage much of the added sand
