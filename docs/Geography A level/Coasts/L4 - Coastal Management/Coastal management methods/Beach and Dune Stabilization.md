**How it works:**
- The beach and existing sand dunes have plants such as Lyme or Marram planted on them to stabilize dunes.
	- Also reduces wind speed, reducing weathering
**Pros:**
- Cheap
- Very natural and utilizes natural defenses against coastal erosion
- Provides habitats
- Absorbs wave energy and protects coasts during storms
**Cons:**
- Storms can damage sand dunes
- While vegetation grows, areas must be zoned off
