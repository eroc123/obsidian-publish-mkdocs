**How it works:**
- Reducing the amount of water in a cliff will reduce the chance of mass movement such as landslides.
	- Materials such as clay are especially vulnerable as it is easily erodable and can slip when wet.
**Pros:**
- Very cheap
- Effective at protecting cliffs
**Cons:**
- When rocks dry out, portions of the cliff may collapse
