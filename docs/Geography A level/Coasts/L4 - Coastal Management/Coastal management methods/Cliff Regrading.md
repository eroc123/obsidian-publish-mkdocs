**How it works:**
- Reducing the angle of the cliff, to ensure that it is not vulnerable to slumping or collapse
- 
**Pros:**
- Very cheap
- Works with the environment
- Sustainable
- Vegetation can be planted to further stabilize the cliff
**Cons:**
- Portions of the cliff need to be removed, leading to a slight retreat of the cliff
- May not immediately yield results as vegetation takes time to grow
