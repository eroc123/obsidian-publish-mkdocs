- **The protection of coasts against flooding and erosion.**
	- Coastal management can use methods of protection such as hard engineering and soft engineering methods.
- **[[Hard Engineering]] - Building some sort of structure as a physical defense to stop or alter natural processes. ** 
	- Done to reduce wave energy
	- Usually is very expensive and requires ongoing maintenance
	- Long lasting and is effective
	- Artificial and can look ugly
	- Can increase erosion in areas not protected
- **[[Soft Engineering]] - Working with natural features such as sand dunes or beaches to protect coasts.**
	- Works with natural processes
	- Cheaper
	- Looks more natural
	- May be less effective and may not last as long
	- Less damaging to the environment
