- Coastal management is a very expensive investment by governments, therefore it is only necessary in places where there is significant economic activity, large numbers of people/settlements or recreational/scenic value.

#### Places where coastal management is unnecessary
- Low-risk places that do not face erosion or coastal flooding threats
- Places where there are low populations or little economic activity
