**How it works:**
- Low lying wooden walls that are placed at intervals along the coast perpendicular to the sea
- They capture sand that moves via longshore drift in order to help build up beaches in areas with significant coastal erosion
	- Wide beaches can protect against coastal erosion by absorbing wave energy, reducing their impact
**Pros:**
- Easy to build
- Are relatively cheap 
- Long durability
- Are softer than most hard engineering techniques
- Low maintenance
- Efficient at protecting beaches and helps build them up
**Cons:**
- Reduce sediment supply down drift of the groynes, which can result in issues down drift
	- These include a thinner beach down drift, which can move the problem of coastal erosion and increase it down drift of the groynes.
- Looks ugly
