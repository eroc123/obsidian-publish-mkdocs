#### Importance of coasts
- **Within 60 kilometers of a coast:**
	- 75% of the world's major cities
	- 50% of the worlds population
- Provide tourism and recreation opportunities
- Used for transport and the majority of the world's trade, such as via ships
	- Ships are also the most economically efficient way of transporting goods in bulk
- Used for fishing and resources
- Large scale industry located on coasts
#### Importance of coastal management
- Large numbers of people are at risk of coastal erosion and flooding, with the number likely to increase due to climate change 
	- Caused by worsening storms and sea level rise
- Required for the protection of settlements, economic activity and industry
	- Many major cities already face threats from the sea, such as Bangkok and Jakarta
- Protect against natural habitats - although this is seen as a less important reason to protect coasts
