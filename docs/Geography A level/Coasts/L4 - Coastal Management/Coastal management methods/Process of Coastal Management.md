- Coastline gets split into sediment cells, which makes it easier to vizualize impacts of coastal management
	- Also easier to determine where protection is needed and where it isn't needed to save costs
- For example, a coastal defense structure erected in one sediment cell will have little to no effect on another sediment cell, but will have significant effect within the sediment cell.
