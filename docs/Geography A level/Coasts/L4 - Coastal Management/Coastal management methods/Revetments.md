**How it works:**
- Sloping structures built on the base of a cliff or on embankments or shorelines
	- Can be concrete or wooden
- Similar to a sea wall
- Idea is to absorb wave energy in order to prevent the erosion of a cliff or shorelines.
- Can have rippled surfaces to increase effectiveness
**Pros:**
- Requires less maintenance than sea walls
- Effective at absorbing wave energy and reducing coastal erosion
- Cheaper than sea walls
**Cons:**
- Looks ugly
- Still relatively expensive
- Waves can undercut the structure and compromise i
- Can make beaches inaccessable
