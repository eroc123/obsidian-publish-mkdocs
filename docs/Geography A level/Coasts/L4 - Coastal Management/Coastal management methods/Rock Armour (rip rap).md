**How it works:**
- Rocks and stones that have been placed on the base or foot of a cliff
- The rocks are not bound together, but they are interlocked
- Idea is to dissipate wave energy and reduce wave's erosive power
**Pros:**
- Easy to build and install
- Are relatively cheap 
- Natural appearance compared to other hard engineering structures
- Are effective at absorbing wave energy

**Cons:**
- Requires maintenance after time, as the rocks get worn down by waves
- Can be bad for the ecosystem
- Can make the beach unaccessable
- Not effective in storm conditions
