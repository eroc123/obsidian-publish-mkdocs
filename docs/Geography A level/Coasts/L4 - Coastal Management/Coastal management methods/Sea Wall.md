**How it works:**
- A large vertical concrete structure built facing the sea in order to block (or deflect) wave energy
	- Idea is to significantly reduce erosion of the coast behind by blocking the waves
- Traditional structures are large flat walls whilst more modern structures are curved to reflect wave energy back into the sea
**Pros:**
- Protects the base of cliffs, settlements and where people live
	- This prevents the cliff from being eroded, reducing the chance of collapse
- Very effective protection against coastal protection
- Can be used as a promenade 

**Cons:**
- Looks very artificial and unnatural
- Expensive to build and maintain
- Can make beaches inaccessable
- Waves can erode and undercut the seawall structure
- Waves in storm conditions can overtop seawalls and lead to coastal flooding behind it
