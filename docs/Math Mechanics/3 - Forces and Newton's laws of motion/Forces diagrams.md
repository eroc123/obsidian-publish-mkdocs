In most cases, any object have many different kinds of forces acting on it. It is therefore useful to draw a force diagram for each individual force acting on the object to better visualise the resultant forces.

All forces are vector quantities, they have a direction and a magnitude. Therefore a force diagram must include all of the following for each force
- The direction of the force
- The magnitude of the force
- Line of action

Since all forces have a [[Perpendicular component of a vector|horizontal and vertical component]], we can calculate the resultant force for any and all forces acting on an object.
