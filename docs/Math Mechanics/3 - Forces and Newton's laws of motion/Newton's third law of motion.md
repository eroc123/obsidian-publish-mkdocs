> When one object exerts a force on another there is always a reaction of the same kind that is equal, and opposite in direction, to the acting force

If an object is placed on a table, gravity still acts on the object. The object is therefore experiencing constant acceleration. However, it is not moving. This would only make sense if the table is also constantly pushing against the downwards force caused by gravity on the object.
