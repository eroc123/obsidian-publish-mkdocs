During the exam, when answering questions, always make sure to round to the correct decimal places

Read the question carefully when deciding on the number of places to use. 
- You can not give your answer to more decimal places than what you can measure using your instruments
- If unsure or not given in the question, round to 3 sf
- When making a estimate, give answer only to 1 or 2 sf
