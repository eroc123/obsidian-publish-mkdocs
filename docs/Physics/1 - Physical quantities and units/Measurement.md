No measurement can be "exact"

Accuracy is the closeness of agreement between a measured value and a true or accepted value

Precision is the degree of exactness (or refinement) of a measurement (results from limitation of measuring device)

## Accuracy of measurements vs Precision of measurements

A measurement is **accurate** if it has little [[Random and systematic errors|systematic error]]

A measurement is **precise** if it has little [[Random and systematic errors|random errors]]

A measurement can be of great precision but be inaccurate if it has a zero offset error
#### Precision of Instruments

Analog instruments
- 1/2 of the smallest increment

Digital instruments
- smallest scale division on the display
