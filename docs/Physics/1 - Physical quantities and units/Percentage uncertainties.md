**NOTE**: Analysis of uncertainties will not be expected for **trigonometric** or
**logarithmic** functions in examinations

Unfortunately, there is no general rule for determining the uncertainty.

##### Calculating absolute uncertainty
n trials of quantity x leads to distribution of values (x1, x2, x3,…)

$\text{Average value} = { \text{sum of all measurements} \over \text{number of measurements}}$

$\text{Absolute uncertainty } \Delta x = {range \over 2} = {x_{max} - x_{min} \over 2}$

Don’t forget that each individual measurement has readability uncertainty

##### Calculating percentage of uncertainty

$\text{Percentage uncertainties(error)} = {\Delta x \over x} 100\%$   <- When you have large value of $x$ with the same level of accuracy, the uncertainty decreases. 

$\Delta x$ is basically the $\pm \text{ value}$ that an instrument have (the [[Accuracy vs precision|precision]] of the insrumen) 

When you are given multiple uncertainties, all you have to do is to add them up
