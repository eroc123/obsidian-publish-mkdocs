**Random error** refers to the random fluctuations in the measured data due to:
- Readability of the instrument
	- e.g. Parallax error
- The effect of something changing in the surroundings between measurements
- The observer's measurement error

**Systematic errors** refers to the error caused by the measuring instrument being "out of adjustment"
- Zero offset error
- A meter stick might be worn off or rounded
- An instrument that is improperly calibrated
- Poor technique by the observer

**Zero offset** error applies only to analogue instruments. It occurs when there is a misalignment between what the instrument measures and the actual value. 
- E.g. ruler with slight padding on each end. This is a zero offset error as it "offsets" the zero
