**Suvat equations used to calculate vertical and horizontal components of projectile:**
- Vertical velocity at any given moment (t) if there's a starting velocity, e.g. if a ball is thrown upwards. [[SUVAT equations|v = u - gt]] (if upwards is taken as positive)
- Displacement at any given moment if there is no horizontal displacement, e.g. ball thrown directly upwards: [[SUVAT equations|y = ut -Â½gt2]] (this is assuming that upwards is taken as positive)
- Object with an initial velocity upwards, the velocity will be 0 at the highest point (where the object goes from going up to falling)
- To get combined velocity (both horizontal and vertical component combined) use Pythagoras $\sqrt{(v^2_x+v^2_y)}= v$
- To get direction of projectile, use trigonometry
