**Features of a projectile:** (for as level physic)
- Only force acting upon a projectile is gravity in a directly downward direction. Value of g: $g=9.81ms^{-2}$
- Horizontal speed is not affected, remains constant
- Rate of change of vertical component is constantÂ 
- If upwards is taken as a positive value, then the vertical speed is always reducing at a constant rate whilst if downwards is taken as a positive value then the vertical speed is always increasing at a constant rate
- Horizontal speed does not affect the duration that a projectile remains in the air (only the vertical component and height above ground does)
- Horizontal speed does affect how far a projectile travels (the higher the speed, the further a projectile travels)
