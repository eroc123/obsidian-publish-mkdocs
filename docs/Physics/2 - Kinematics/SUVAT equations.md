**Suvat** stands for:
s: Displacement
u: Initial Velocity
v: Final Velocity
a: Acceleration
t: Time

### Suvat equations

- Equation 1: v=u+at (when displacement is unknown)
- Equation 2: s=12(u+v)t (when acceleration is unknown)
- Equation 3: s=ut+12at2 (when final velocity is unknown)
- Equation 4: v2=u2+2as (when time is unknown)
- Equation 5: s=vt-12at2 (when initial velocity is unknown)
