$Force \times Distance$ (Nm)/(J) Juels

Work is done on an object when a force acting on it makes it move
It gives the object energy

$1N$ is roughly a typical apple

$W = F cos(\theta)$

### Hookes law

$F = -kx$

${(F - 0) \over 2} = {1 \over 2} F$

$w = {1 \over 2} Fx = {1 \over 2} kx^2$

### Mechanical Power

Work done per unit time

Units: ($Js^{-1}$)($W$) $Watts$

Power is defined as the rate of energy transfer

$Power = {\Delta Energy \over \Delta time}$ **OR** work done over time

$Power = Force \times velocity$
