At constant speed, all resistive forces are equal to the engine output

### Gaining speed

work done is the sum of the energy lost to surrounding and the gain in kinetic energy due to the increase in speed

$Power = Force \times velocity$ + K.E. gain per second

### Gaining Height

Sum of energy lost to surrounding + gain in G.P.E

$Power = Force \times velocity$ + K.E. gained per second
