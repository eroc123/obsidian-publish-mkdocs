- A **center of gravity** of a body is the point through which a single force on a the body has no turning effect
	- Basically if you apply a force here then the body won't turn.
-**Center of mass** is the point where all distributed mass in a body is concentrated.

- Support forces $S = W_1 + W_0 + W_2$ (The force that acts on the pivot or fulcrum.)
	- where $W_0$ is the weight of the body, and $W_1, W_2$ are the weights of the masses.
	- Support forces act on the center of mass, as there is no turning effect there.
