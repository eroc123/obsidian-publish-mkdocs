Rocket example
Rocket have a change in mass over time, this needs to be taken in account of when doing calculations

Water jet example
To calculate the change in momentum , we find the mass moving out each second $$\text{Mass each second} = 1000 \times 2 \times 10^{-4} = 0.2 \text{kg per second}$$
Next, to find the velocity, we find the volume leaving per second and the area. $2 \times 10^{-4} / 7.2 \times 19^{-4} = 0.278  m$ Therefore the velocity is $0.278ms^{-1}$

Therefore, the change in momentum is $0.2 \times 0.278  =  0.0556$
