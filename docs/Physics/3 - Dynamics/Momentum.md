An object's momentum depends on the velocity at which it is moving, as well as the mass of the object

therefore, $Momentum = mass \times velocity$ 
$p = m\times v$

[[Derived units|Unit for momentum]] - $p(kg ms^{-1}) = m (kg) \times (ms^{-1})$
Note since velocity is a [[Scalar and vector quantites|vector quantity]], this makes momentum a [[Scalar and vector quantites|vector quantity]] too.

### Conservation of momentum

When objects collide, assuming no external forces, momentum is always conserved

However, in almost every situation, collision will always have external forces.
