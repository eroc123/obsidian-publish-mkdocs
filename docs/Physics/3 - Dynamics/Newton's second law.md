$F = m \times a$
However, considering an object with mass m, with a force F acting on it. This causes the object to have a change in velocity, therefore a change in momentum

So, the formula becomes $$F = {m_u - m_v \over t}$$

When written as $$F = {m(u-v) \over t}$$
We can see that its pretty similar to our SUVAT $a = {(u-v) \over t}$
