Since momentum is a [[Scalar & vector|vector]], the sign of it shows the direction of the [[Momentum|momentum]]

If a ball is heading towards a wall, and we take that direction as positive, when it bounces, the momentum will flip to negative, as the velocity will become negative as it rebound.

Initial  velocity - $+u$
Initial momentum = $+mu$

Assuming there is no loss of speed

$Ft = \text{final momentum} - \text{initial momentum}$
$Ft = -mu - (+mu)$
$F = {-2mu \over t}$

If we drop a perfectly bouncy ball on to a hard surface, it should rebound to almost the original height

K.E. just before the impact would be equal to the final K.E. if it is a perfect [[Types of collision|elastic collision]]

For a dropped ball, we just use our normal suvat
