When an object is moving through a fluid (gas or liquid), the object experiences drag.

The size of drag is related to the speed of the object. Eventually, the size of the drag will be equal to the force of acceleration. 

### Factors affecting terminal velocity

The shape: - more streamlined causes higher terminal velocity

The viscosity of the fluid - thicker fluid lowers the terminal velocity

### Car Design

For a given power of an engine, a streamlined car will have a higher speed than a non-streamlined car.
