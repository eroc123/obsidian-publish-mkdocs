When objects hit each other, the result can be either elastic or inelastic

Elastic collision - Momentum conserved, K.E. conserved, total energy conserved

Inelastic collision - Momentum conserved, K.E. not conserved, total energy conserved

Most of the time, collisions will be Inelastic, converting some of the K.E. to other forms of energy
