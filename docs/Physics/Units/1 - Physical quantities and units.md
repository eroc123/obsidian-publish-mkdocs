#physics #syllabus

1. **Physical quantities**
	1. understand that all [[Physical Quantities|physical quantities]] consist of a numerical [[Magnitude|magnitude]] and a unit
	2. make reasonable estimates of physical quantities included within the syllabus
2. **SI units**
	1. recall the following [[SI units|SI base quantities and their units]]: mass (kg), length (m), time (s), current (A), temperature (K)
	2. express [[Derived units|derived units]] as products or quotients of the SI base units and use the derived units for quantities listed in this syllabus as appropriate 
	3. use [[SI units|SI base units]] to check the [[Quantitative vs Qualitative|homogeneity]] of physical equations
	4. recall and use the [[Magnitude|following prefixes and their symbols]] to indicate decimal submultiples or multiples of both [[Derived units|base and derived units]]: pico (p), nano (n), micro (Î¼), milli (m), centi (c), deci (d), kilo (k), mega (M), giga (G), tera (T)
3. **Errors and uncertainties**
	1. understand and explain the effects of [[Random and systematic errors|systematic errors]] (including zero errors) and [[Random and systematic errors|random errors]] in [[Measurement|measurements]]
	2. understand the distinction between [[Measurement|precision and accuracy]]
	3. assess the uncertainty in a [[Derived units|derived quantity]] by simple addition of absolute or [[Percentage uncertainties|percentage uncertainties]]
4. **Scalars and vectors** %%TODO: work on notes from this sub unit%%
	1. understand the difference between [[Scalar and vector quantites|scalar and vector quantities]] and give examples of scalar and vector quantities included in the syllabus
	2. add and subtract coplanar [[Scalar & vector|vectors]]
	3. represent a vector as two [[Perpendicular component of a vector|perpendicular components]]
