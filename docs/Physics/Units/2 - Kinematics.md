1. **Equations of motion**
	1. define and use [[SUVAT equations|distance, displacement, speed, velocity and acceleration]]
	2. use graphical methods to represent distance, displacement, speed, velocity and acceleration%%TODO: make notes for deriving SUVAT%%
	3. determine displacement from the area under a velocity–time graph%%see above%%
	4. determine velocity using the gradient of a displacement–time graph%%see above%%
	5. determine acceleration using the gradient of a velocity–time graph%%see above%%
	6. derive, from the definitions of velocity and acceleration, equations that represent uniformly accelerated motion in a straight line%%see above%%
	7. [[Projectiles & SUVAT|solve problems using equations]] that represent uniformly accelerated motion in a straight line, including the motion of bodies falling in a uniform gravitational field without air resistance
	8. describe an experiment to determine the acceleration of free fall using a falling object
	9. describe and explain motion due to a uniform velocity in one direction and a uniform acceleration in a perpendicular direction
