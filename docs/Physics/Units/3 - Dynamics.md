1. **Momentum and Newton’s laws of motion**
	1. understand that mass is the property of an object that resists change in motion
	2. recall F = ma and solve problems using it, understanding that acceleration and resultant force are always in the same direction
	3. define and use[[Momentum| linear momentum]] as the product of mass and velocity
	4. define and use [[Force as change of momentum|force as rate of change of momentum]]
	5. state and apply each of Newton’s laws of motion
	6. describe and use the concept of weight as the effect of a gravitational field on a mass and recall that the weight of an object is equal to the product of its mass and the acceleration of free fall
2. **Non-uniform motion**
	1. show a qualitative understanding of frictional forces and viscous/drag forces including air resistance (no treatment of the coefficients of friction and viscosity is required, and a simple model of drag force increasing as speed increases is sufficient)
	2. describe and explain qualitatively the motion of objects in a uniform gravitational field with air resistance
	3. understand that objects moving against a resistive force may reach a [[Terminal Velocity|terminal (constant) velocity]]
3. **Linear momentum and its conservation**
	1. state the principle of [[Momentum|conservation of momentum]]
	2. apply the principle of conservation of momentum to solve simple problems, including [[Types of collision|elastic and inelastic interactions]] between objects in both one [[Impact at an angle|and two dimensions ]](knowledge of the concept of coefficient of restitution is not required)
	3. recall that, for a perfectly [[Types of collision|elastic collision]], the relative speed of approach is equal to the relative speed of separation
	4. understand that, while momentum of a system is always conserved in interactions between objects, some change in kinetic energy may take place
