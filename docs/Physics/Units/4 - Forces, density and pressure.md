1. **Turning effects of forces**
	1. understand that the weight of an object may be taken as acting at a single point known as its center of gravity
	2. define and apply the moment of a force
	3. understand that a couple is a pair of forces that acts to produce rotation only
	4. define and apply the torque of a couple
2. **Equilibrium of forces**
	1. state and apply the principle of moments
	2. understand that, when there is no resultant force and no resultant torque, a system is in equilibrium
	3. use a vector triangle to represent coplanar forces in equilibrium
3. **Density and pressure**
	1. define and use density
	2. define and use pressure
	3. derive, from the definitions of pressure and density, the equation for hydrostatic pressure ∆p = ρg∆h
	4. use the equation ∆p = ρg∆h
	5. understand that the upthrust acting on an object in a fluid is due to a difference in hydrostatic pressure
	6. calculate the upthrust acting on an object in a fluid using the equation F = ρgV (Archimedes’ principle)
