1. **Energy conservation**
	1. understand the concept of work, and recall and use work done = force Ã— displacement in the direction of the force
	2. recall and apply the principle of conservation of energy
	3. recall and understand that the efficiency of a system is the ratio of useful energy output from the system to the total energy input
	4. use the concept of efficiency to solve problems
	5. define power as work done per unit time
	6. solve problems using P = W / t
	7. derive P = Fv and use it to solve problems
2. **Gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy**
	1. derive, using $W = Fs$, the formula $\Delta EP = mg\Delta h$ for [[G.P.E|gravitational potential energy]] changes in a uniform gravitational field
	2. recall and use the formula $\Delta EP = mg\Delta h$ for gravitational potential energy changes in a uniform gravitational field
	3. derive, using the equations of motion, the formula for kinetic energy $E_K = {1\over2}mv^2$ 
	4. recall and use $E_K = {1\over2}mv^2$
